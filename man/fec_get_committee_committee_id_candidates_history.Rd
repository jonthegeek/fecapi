\description{
Find out a candidate's characteristics over time. This is particularly useful if the candidate runs for the same office in different districts or you want to know more about a candidate's previous races. This information is organized by \code{candidate_id}, so it won't help you find a candidate who ran for different offices over time; candidates get a new ID for each office.
