\description{
This endpoint provides information about a committee's Form 3, Form 3X, or Form 3P financial reports, which are aggregated by two-year period. We refer to two-year periods as a \code{cycle}. The cycle is named after the even-numbered year and includes the year before it. To obtain totals from 2013 and 2014, you would use 2014. In odd-numbered years, the current cycle is the next year â€” for example, in 2015, the current cycle is 2016. For presidential and Senate candidates, multiple two-year cycles exist between elections.
