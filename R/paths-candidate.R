#' Get candidate candidate id
#'
#' This endpoint is useful for finding detailed information about a particular
#' candidate. Use the `candidate_id` to find the most recent information about
#' that candidate.
#'
#' @inheritParams fec_call_api

#' @param candidate_status One-letter code explaining if the candidate is: - C
#'   present candidate - F future candidate - N not yet a candidate - P prior
#'   candidate
#' @param cycle Two-year election cycle in which a candidate runs for office.
#'   Calculated from Form 2. The cycle begins with an odd year and is named for
#'   its ending, even year. This cycle follows the traditional house election
#'   cycle and subdivides the presidential and Senate elections into comparable
#'   two-year blocks. To retrieve data for the entire four years of a
#'   presidential term or six years of a senatorial term, you will need the
#'   `election_full` flag.
#' @param sort_nulls_last Toggle that sorts null values last
#' @param state US state or territory where a candidate runs for office
#' @param district Two-digit US House distirict of the office the candidate is
#'   running for. Presidential, Senate and House at-large candidates will have
#'   District 00.
#' @param year Retrieve records pertaining to a particular election year. The
#'   list of election years is based on a candidate filing a statement of
#'   candidacy (F2) for that year.
#' @param name Name (candidate or committee) to search for. Alias for 'q'.
#' @param sort_hide_null Hide null values on sorted column(s).
#' @param federal_funds_flag A boolean the describes if a presidential candidate
#'   has accepted federal funds. The flag will be false for House and Senate
#'   candidates.
#' @param per_page The number of results returned per page. Defaults to 20.
#' @param page For paginating through results, starting at page 1
#' @param sort Provide a field to sort by. Use `-` for descending order.
#' @param has_raised_funds A boolean that describes if a candidate's committee
#'   has ever received any receipts for their campaign for this particular
#'   office. (Candidates have separate candidate IDs for each office.)
#' @param election_year Year of election
#' @param sort_null_only Toggle that filters out all rows having sort column
#'   that is non-null
#' @param incumbent_challenge One-letter code ('I', 'C', 'O') explaining if the
#'   candidate is an incumbent, a challenger, or if the seat is open.
#' @param party Three-letter code for the party affiliated with a candidate or
#'   committee. For example, DEM for Democratic Party and REP for Republican
#'   Party.

#' Get candidate candidate id totals

#' This endpoint provides information about a committee's Form 3, Form 3X, or Form 3P financial reports, which are aggregated by two-year period. We refer to two-year periods as a `cycle`. The cycle is named after the even-numbered year and includes the year before it. To obtain totals from 2013 and 2014, you would use 2014. In odd-numbered years, the current cycle is the next year â€” for example, in 2015, the current cycle is 2016. For presidential and Senate candidates, multiple two-year cycles exist between elections.
