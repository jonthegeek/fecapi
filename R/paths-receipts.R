#' Get schedules schedule a
#'
#' This description is for both ​`/schedules​/schedule_a​/` and ​ `/schedules​/schedule_a​/{sub_id}​/`. This endpoint provides itemized receipts. Schedule A records describe itemized receipts, including contributions from individuals. If you are interested in contributions from an individual, use the `/schedules/schedule_a/` endpoint. For a more complete description of all Schedule A records visit [About receipts data](https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/about-campaign-finance-data/about-receipts-data/). If you are interested in our &quot;is_individual&quot; methodology visit our [methodology page](https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/about-campaign-finance-data/methodology/). ​The `/schedules​/schedule_a​/` endpoint is not paginated by page number. This endpoint uses keyset pagination to improve query performance and these indices are required to properly page through this large dataset. To request the next page, you should append the values found in the `last_indexes` object from pagination to the URL of your last request as additional parameters. For example, when sorting by `contribution_receipt_date`, you might receive a page of results with the two scenarios of following pagination information: case #1: ``` pagination: { pages: 2152643, per_page: 20, count: 43052850, last_indexes: { last_index: &quot;230880619&quot;, last_contribution_receipt_date: &quot;2014-01-01&quot; } } ``` &lt;br/&gt; case #2 (results which include contribution_receipt_date = NULL): ``` pagination: { pages: 2152644, per_page: 20, count: 43052850, last_indexes: { last_index: &quot;230880639&quot;, sort_null_only: True } } ``` To fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=230880619` and `last_contribution_receipt_date=2014-01-01` to the URL and when reaching `contribution_receipt_date=NULL`, append `last_index=230880639` and `sort_null_only=True`. We strongly advise paging through these results using sort indices. The default sort is acending by `contribution_receipt_date` (`deprecated`, will be descending). If you do not page using sort indices, some transactions may be unintentionally filtered out. Calls to ​`/schedules​/schedule_a​/` may return many records. For large result sets, the record counts found in the pagination object are approximate; you will need to page through the records until no records are returned. To avoid throwing the &quot;out of range&quot; exception on the last page, one recommandation is to use total count and `per_page` to control the traverse loop of results. ​The `/schedules​/schedule_a​/{sub_id}​/` endpoint returns a single transaction, but it does include a pagination object class. Please ignore the information in that object class.

#' @param max_load_date Maximum load date
#' @param max_amount Filter for all amounts less than a value.
#' @param max_image_number Maxium image number of the page where the schedule item is reported
#' @param contributor_occupation Occupation of contributor, filers need to make an effort to gather this information
#' @param recipient_committee_designation The one-letter designation code of the organization: - A authorized by a candidate - J joint fundraising committee - P principal campaign committee of a candidate - U unauthorized - B lobbyist/registrant PAC - D leadership PAC
#' @param sort_hide_null Hide null values on sorted column(s).
#' @param is_individual Restrict to non-earmarked individual contributions where memo code is true. Filtering individuals is useful to make sure contributions are not double reported and in creating breakdowns of the amount of money coming from individuals.
#' @param line_number Filter for form and line number using the following format: `FORM-LINENUMBER`. For example an argument such as `F3X-16` would filter down to all entries from form `F3X` line number `16`.
#' @param contributor_type Filters individual or committee contributions based on line number
#' @param recipient_committee_type The one-letter type code of the organization: - C communication cost - D delegate - E electioneering communication - H House - I independent expenditure filer (not a committee) - N PAC - nonqualified - O independent expenditure-only (super PACs) - P presidential - Q PAC - qualified - S Senate - U single candidate independent expenditure - V PAC with non-contribution account, nonqualified - W PAC with non-contribution account, qualified - X party, nonqualified - Y party, qualified - Z national party non-federal account
#' @param per_page The number of results returned per page. Defaults to 20.
#' @param contributor_zip Zip code of contributor
#' @param contributor_city City of contributor
#' @param last_index Index of last result from previous page
#' @param last_contribution_receipt_amount When sorting by `contribution_receipt_amount`, this is populated with the `contribution_receipt_amount` of the last result. However, you will need to pass the index of that last result to `last_index` to get the next page.
#' @param contributor_id The FEC identifier should be represented here if the contributor is registered with the FEC.
#' @param recipient_committee_org_type The one-letter code for the kind for organization: - C corporation - L labor organization - M membership organization - T trade association - V cooperative - W corporation without capital stock
#' @param contributor_state State of contributor
#' @param sort Provide a field to sort by. Use `-` for descending order.
#' @param two_year_transaction_period This is a two-year period that is derived from the year a transaction took place in the Itemized Schedule A and Schedule B tables. In cases where we have the date of the transaction (contribution_receipt_date in schedules/schedule_a, disbursement_date in schedules/schedule_b) the two_year_transaction_period is named after the ending, even-numbered year. If we do not have the date of the transaction, we fall back to using the report year (report_year in both tables) instead, making the same cycle adjustment as necessary. If no transaction year is specified, the results default to the most current cycle.
#' @param min_date Minimum date
#' @param committee_id A unique identifier assigned to each committee or filer registered with the FEC. In general committee id's begin with the letter C which is followed by eight digits.
#' @param contributor_employer Employer of contributor, filers need to make an effort to gather this information
#' @param min_load_date Minimum load date
#' @param last_contribution_receipt_date When sorting by `contribution_receipt_date`, this is populated with the `contribution_receipt_date` of the last result. However, you will need to pass the index of that last result to `last_index` to get the next page.

#' Get schedules schedule a sub id
#'
#' This description is for both ​`/schedules​/schedule_a​/` and ​ `/schedules​/schedule_a​/{sub_id}​/`. This endpoint provides itemized receipts. Schedule A records describe itemized receipts, including contributions from individuals. If you are interested in contributions from an individual, use the `/schedules/schedule_a/` endpoint. For a more complete description of all Schedule A records visit [About receipts data](https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/about-campaign-finance-data/about-receipts-data/). If you are interested in our &quot;is_individual&quot; methodology visit our [methodology page](https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/about-campaign-finance-data/methodology/). ​The `/schedules​/schedule_a​/` endpoint is not paginated by page number. This endpoint uses keyset pagination to improve query performance and these indices are required to properly page through this large dataset. To request the next page, you should append the values found in the `last_indexes` object from pagination to the URL of your last request as additional parameters. For example, when sorting by `contribution_receipt_date`, you might receive a page of results with the two scenarios of following pagination information: case #1: ``` pagination: { pages: 2152643, per_page: 20, count: 43052850, last_indexes: { last_index: &quot;230880619&quot;, last_contribution_receipt_date: &quot;2014-01-01&quot; } } ``` &lt;br/&gt; case #2 (results which include contribution_receipt_date = NULL): ``` pagination: { pages: 2152644, per_page: 20, count: 43052850, last_indexes: { last_index: &quot;230880639&quot;, sort_null_only: True } } ``` To fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=230880619` and `last_contribution_receipt_date=2014-01-01` to the URL and when reaching `contribution_receipt_date=NULL`, append `last_index=230880639` and `sort_null_only=True`. We strongly advise paging through these results using sort indices. The default sort is acending by `contribution_receipt_date` (`deprecated`, will be descending). If you do not page using sort indices, some transactions may be unintentionally filtered out. Calls to ​`/schedules​/schedule_a​/` may return many records. For large result sets, the record counts found in the pagination object are approximate; you will need to page through the records until no records are returned. To avoid throwing the &quot;out of range&quot; exception on the last page, one recommandation is to use total count and `per_page` to control the traverse loop of results. ​The `/schedules​/schedule_a​/{sub_id}​/` endpoint returns a single transaction, but it does include a pagination object class. Please ignore the information in that object class.

#' @param max_amount Filter for all amounts less than a value.
#' @param max_image_number Maxium image number of the page where the schedule item is reported
#' @param contributor_occupation Occupation of contributor, filers need to make an effort to gather this information
#' @param recipient_committee_designation The one-letter designation code of the organization: - A authorized by a candidate - J joint fundraising committee - P principal campaign committee of a candidate - U unauthorized - B lobbyist/registrant PAC - D leadership PAC
#' @param sort_hide_null Hide null values on sorted column(s).
#' @param is_individual Restrict to non-earmarked individual contributions where memo code is true. Filtering individuals is useful to make sure contributions are not double reported and in creating breakdowns of the amount of money coming from individuals.
#' @param line_number Filter for form and line number using the following format: `FORM-LINENUMBER`. For example an argument such as `F3X-16` would filter down to all entries from form `F3X` line number `16`.
#' @param contributor_type Filters individual or committee contributions based on line number
#' @param recipient_committee_type The one-letter type code of the organization: - C communication cost - D delegate - E electioneering communication - H House - I independent expenditure filer (not a committee) - N PAC - nonqualified - O independent expenditure-only (super PACs) - P presidential - Q PAC - qualified - S Senate - U single candidate independent expenditure - V PAC with non-contribution account, nonqualified - W PAC with non-contribution account, qualified - X party, nonqualified - Y party, qualified - Z national party non-federal account
#' @param per_page The number of results returned per page. Defaults to 20.
#' @param contributor_zip Zip code of contributor
#' @param contributor_city City of contributor
#' @param last_index Index of last result from previous page
#' @param last_contribution_receipt_amount When sorting by `contribution_receipt_amount`, this is populated with the `contribution_receipt_amount` of the last result. However, you will need to pass the index of that last result to `last_index` to get the next page.
#' @param contributor_id The FEC identifier should be represented here if the contributor is registered with the FEC.
#' @param recipient_committee_org_type The one-letter code for the kind for organization: - C corporation - L labor organization - M membership organization - T trade association - V cooperative - W corporation without capital stock
#' @param contributor_state State of contributor
#' @param sort Provide a field to sort by. Use `-` for descending order.
#' @param two_year_transaction_period This is a two-year period that is derived from the year a transaction took place in the Itemized Schedule A and Schedule B tables. In cases where we have the date of the transaction (contribution_receipt_date in schedules/schedule_a, disbursement_date in schedules/schedule_b) the two_year_transaction_period is named after the ending, even-numbered year. If we do not have the date of the transaction, we fall back to using the report year (report_year in both tables) instead, making the same cycle adjustment as necessary. If no transaction year is specified, the results default to the most current cycle.
#' @param min_date Minimum date
#' @param committee_id A unique identifier assigned to each committee or filer registered with the FEC. In general committee id's begin with the letter C which is followed by eight digits.
#' @param contributor_employer Employer of contributor, filers need to make an effort to gather this information
#' @param min_load_date Minimum load date
#' @param last_contribution_receipt_date When sorting by `contribution_receipt_date`, this is populated with the `contribution_receipt_date` of the last result. However, you will need to pass the index of that last result to `last_index` to get the next page.
