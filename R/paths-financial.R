#' Get committee committee id reports
#'
#' Each report represents the summary information from Form 3, Form 3X and Form 3P. These reports have key statistics that illuminate the financial status of a given committee. Things like cash on hand, debts owed by committee, total receipts, and total disbursements are especially helpful for understanding a committee's financial dealings. By default, this endpoint includes both amended and final versions of each report. To restrict to only the final versions of each report, use `is_amended=false`; to retrieve only reports that have been amended, use `is_amended=true`. Several different reporting structures exist, depending on the type of organization that submits financial information. To see an example of these reporting requirements, look at the summary and detailed summary pages of Form 3, Form 3X, and Form 3P.

#' Get committee committee id totals
#'
#' This endpoint provides information about a committee's Form 3, Form 3X, or Form 3P financial reports, which are aggregated by two-year period. We refer to two-year periods as a `cycle`. The cycle is named after the even-numbered year and includes the year before it. To obtain totals from 2013 and 2014, you would use 2014. In odd-numbered years, the current cycle is the next year â€” for example, in 2015, the current cycle is 2016. For presidential and Senate candidates, multiple two-year cycles exist between elections.

#' Get elections

#' Look at the top-level financial information for all candidates running for the same office. Choose a 2-year cycle, and `house`, `senate` or `presidential`. If you are looking for a Senate seat, you will need to select the state using a two-letter abbreviation. House races require state and a two-digit district number. Since this endpoint reflects financial information, it will only have candidates once they file financial reporting forms.
